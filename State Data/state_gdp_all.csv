"1/ Real GDP is in millions of chained 2012 dollars. Industry detail is based on the 2012 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). Calculations are performed on unrounded data. Chained (2012) dollar series are calculated as the product of the chain-type quantity index and the 2012 current-dollar value of the corresponding series, divided by 100. Because the formula for the chain-type quantity indexes uses weights of more than one period, the corresponding chained-dollar estimates are usually not additive. The difference between the United States and sum-of-states reflects federal military and civilian activity located overseas, as well as the differences in source data used to estimate GDP by industry and the expenditures measure of real GDP.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
